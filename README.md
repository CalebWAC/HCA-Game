Expedition (tentatively named) is a puzzle platformer game where you have to traverse a 13x13 world using power-ups and in-game elements to complete each level.

## Playing the Game
The game is not complete yet, but it is still fully playable. There may be a few bugs that could show up. If one occurs, leaving the level and reopening it can sometimes resolve unexpected bugs.

To play the game, one can download the source code and either run it through Godot or go into the Builds folder and run it from there. The executables in the releases do not work, so directly running it from the Builds folder is the best option. The Windows executable has been tested while the Linux has not, although it should work the same.

## Controls
The controls for the game are presented in the game as needed. WASD controls the left, right, forward, and backward motion of the player. The Q and E keys control the rotation of the character, left and right, respectively. The camera can be rotated by holding the left mouse button and dragging.

### Power-Ups
- Grappling hook: Click on any orange diamond in the level to fly towards it when the grappling hook is enabled, given that it is within range. 
- Terrain manipulator: Click on any terrain block and use the arrow keys to increase or decrease its height. Click anywhere else to enable player control again.
- Invisible Glasses: This works automatically once you get it. They allow you to see things that were previously invisible within a given radius of the player.



## Change History

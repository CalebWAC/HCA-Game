Expedition (tentatively named) is a puzzle platformer game where you have to traverse a 13x13 world using power-ups and in-game elements to complete each level

## Playing the Game
The game is in a playable state but far from complete. There are only two levels currently made, and there may be a few bugs that could show up.
The executables for Windows and Linux are in the releases of the repository. The Windows version has been tested, but the Linux one has not, although it should work the same.

## Controls
The arrow keys control the left, right, forward, and backward motion of the player. The Q and E keys control the rotation of the character, left and right, respectively. The camera can be rotated when by holding the left mouse button and dragging.
The power-ups are currently represented by spheres. The power-up in the first game is the grappling hook. Click on any orange diamond in the level to fly towards it when the grappling hook is enabled, given that it is within range. The power-up in the second level is the terrain manipulator. Click on any terrain block and use the up arrow to increase its height. Click anywhere else to enable player control again. Currently, the terrain manipulator cannot decrease the height of the terrain.
